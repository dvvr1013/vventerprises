humanheartnatureSunflower Beauty Oil's latest miracle comes from Human Nature user Rosalina Rellona who has had psoriasis since the start of the year.

Psoriasis is a condition wherein the production of skin cells goes on overdrive, resulting in dry, red and scaly patches on skin which are often accompanied by pain and itching.

Though there is no absolute cure for psoriasis yet, fortunately the symptoms can be treated. One way is to use topical treatment that helps prevent dry skin, has no chemicals that may cause inflammation or adverse reaction due to synthetic perfumes or dyes, and can soothe itching.

Sunflower Beauty Oil is a safe, natural option that meets all of these requirements. A very effective emollient, it provides a protective barrier for the skin, helping it retain its natural moisture and relieve dryness. It also has anti-inflammatory properties to help with the redness.
